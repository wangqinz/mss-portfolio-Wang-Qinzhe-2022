## Modern Statistical Machine Learning Methods Applied to Airbnb
 
## Abstract:

Airbnb is one of the most popular room-booking platforms. The majority of bookings go successfully, howeverÂ some may run into a problem with availability.
This research attempts to help consumers avoid being unable to book their favorite listings by examining how numerous criteria such as location, host, property condition, season, 
and others affect listing availability.
More specifically, I'm interested in regional data from Asheville, North Carolina, 
because it's a popular tourist destination and a quickly rising area. 
The project will involve extensive exploratory data analysis, model training, parameter tuning, model selection, and evaluation.
 
The work is inspired by a data set from the Inside Airbnb Data Platform, which covers the availability labels and a number of attributes of Airbnb listings, 
including hosting characteristics, room information, listing reviews, and booking month.  The main choices of models are Random Forest and AdaBoost.
On the one hand, the raw dataset contains both categorical and numerical predictors; the above two classification methods perform well in the dataset. 
On the other hand, both two are ensemble learning methods. Therefore they usually outperform a single model and are more Robust as it reduces the dispersion of the predictions.
