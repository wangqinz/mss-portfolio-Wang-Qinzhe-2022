## Modern Statistical Machine Learning Methods Applied to Airbnb
 
## Abstract:

Airbnb is one of the most popular room-booking platforms. The majority of bookings go successfully, howeverÂ some may run into a problem with availability.
My research attempts to help consumers avoid being unable to book their favorite listings by examining how numerous criteria such as location, host, property condition, and seasonality, affect listing availability. More specifically, I consider regional data from Asheville, North Carolina, which is considered a tourist destination and is increasing in its popularity with regards to bookings. Motivated as such, I consider a data set from Inside Airbnb Data Platform, which covers such data as already mentioned. This data set has both categorical and numerical predictors. 

The primary goal of my project is to predict [state what you will predict]. Now state what models are most appropriate and why. Focus on just one motivating questions such that you can answer the question. Compare it to a single model to illustrate the its robustness (what will you compare it to). Please address these concerns and it will be much stronger. (Please talk about how you will build a training set and deal will evaluation metrics and overfitting). 

========

My project will involve extensive exploratory data analysis, model training, parameter tuning, model selection, and evaluation.
 
The work is inspired by a data set from the Inside Airbnb Data Platform, which covers the availability labels and a number of attributes of Airbnb listings, 
including hosting characteristics, room information, listing reviews, and booking month.  

The main choices of models are Random Forest and AdaBoost.
On the one hand, the raw dataset contains both categorical and numerical predictors; the above two classification methods perform well in the dataset. 
On the other hand, both two are ensemble learning methods. Therefore they usually outperform a single model and are more Robust as it reduces the dispersion of the predictions.
